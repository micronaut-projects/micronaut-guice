This module allows importing https://github.com/google/guice[Guice] modules into a Micronaut application making the Guice bindings available for Dependency Injection.

Note that only a subset of the Guice API (primarily what is implemented is the https://google.github.io/guice/api-docs/latest/javadoc/com/google/inject/Binder.html[Guice Binding EDSL]) and the following features are not supported:

* Custom Guice Scopes (other than Singleton) are not supported
* Guice AOP/Interceptors are not supported (use Micronaut AOP instead)
* Guice private modules are not supported
* Static Injection is not supported
* Guice TypeConverters are not supported (use `io.micronaut.core.convert.TypeConverter` instead).
* Guice Listeners are not supported (use `io.micronaut.context.event.BeanCreatedEventListener` instead.)
* None of the `com.google.inject.spi` API is supported.
